<p>
  OpenAPI Parser is an extension aimed at streamlining the process of performing
  web service assessments involving OpenAPI based APIs.
</p>

<p>This extension provides the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    OpenAPI documents can be parsed either from a supplied file or URL. The
    extension can fetch OpenAPI documents directly from a URL using the &quot;Send to
    Swagger Parser&quot; feature under the &quot;Target -> Site map&quot; context menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    Parse OpenAPI documents, formerly known as the &quot;Swagger specification&quot;,
    fully compliant with OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 Specifications (OAS).
  </li>
  <li>
    Requests can be directly viewed/edited within the extension prior to sending
    them to other Burp tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    Requests can be sent to the &quot;Comparer, Intruder, Repeater, Scanner, Site map
    and Scope&quot; Burp tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    Requests matching specific criterias (detailed in the 'Parameters' tab) can
    be intercepted to automatically match and replace the parsed parameters
    default values defined in the 'Parameters' tab. This feature allows for
    fine-tuning of the requests prior to sending them to other Burp's tools
    (e.g., scanner). Edited requests can be viewed within the 'Modified Request
    (OpenAPI Parser)' tab of Burp's message editor.
  </li>
  <li>
    Row highlighting allowing pentesters to highlight "interesting" API calls
    and/or colour code them for reporting purposes.
  </li>
  <li>Supports both JSON and YAML formats.</li>
</ul>
